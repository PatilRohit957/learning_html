  <h2>About the Project</h2>

  <p>
    PhishGuard is a research-based phishing detection system that models
    URLs and their characteristics as a probabilistic graph structure.
    The system applies Loopy Belief Propagation to infer phishing likelihood
    by reasoning over relational dependencies between web entities.
  </p>

  <p>
    This project aims to provide a strong theoretical foundation for
    phishing detection using graph-based probabilistic inference techniques.
